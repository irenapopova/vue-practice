# Difference Between Mounting And Rendering A Component In Vue.JS

## What is Mounting?

Mounting is the process of adding a Vue.js component to the DOM (Document Object Model) for the first time. When a component is mounted, Vue.js creates an instance of the component and inserts it into the specified HTML element. The mounting process involves several steps, including:

1. Creating a new instance of the component
2. Setting up the component’s data, computed properties, and methods
3. Compiling the template of the component
4. Rendering the component to the DOM

In other words, mounting a component is the initialization process that Vue.js performs when it creates a new instance of the component and adds it to the page. Once a component is mounted, it is ready to be interacted with and updated.

## What is Rendering?

Rendering is the process of updating a component’s view based on changes to its data or props. When a component is rendered, Vue.js updates the DOM to reflect any changes made to the component’s state. Rendering involves several steps, including:

1. Re-evaluating the component’s computed properties and methods
2. Updating the component’s data and props
3. Re-rendering the component’s template
4. Updating the DOM to reflect any changes made to the component

In other words, rendering is the process that Vue.js performs to update a component’s view based on changes to its state. Rendering can occur multiple times during the lifecycle of a component, depending on how often its data or props change.

## The Difference Between Mounting and Rendering

In summary, the main difference between mounting and rendering a component in Vue.js is the purpose and timing of each process. Mounting occurs when a component is first added to the page, while rendering occurs when a component’s state changes. Mounting initializes the component and sets it up for interaction, while rendering updates the component’s view based on changes to its state.

It’s important to understand the difference between mounting and rendering when working with Vue.js components. By understanding these concepts, you can more effectively manage the lifecycle of your components and ensure that your application performs as expected.
